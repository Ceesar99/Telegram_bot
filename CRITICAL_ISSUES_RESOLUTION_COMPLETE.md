```python
# Fixed sequence creation with validation
def create_sequences(self, data, target):
    sequences = np.array(sequences)
    targets = np.array(targets)
    
    # Ensure consistent shapes
    if len(sequences.shape) != 3:
        self.logger.error(f"Invalid sequence shape: {sequences.shape}")
        return None, None
        
    if sequences.shape[2] != self.features_count:
        self.logger.error(f"Feature count mismatch: expected {self.features_count}, got {sequences.shape[2]}")
        return None, None
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Training completed successfully
