## 🎮 HOW TO RUN THE SYSTEM

### 🚀 **Quick Start (Demo Mode)**
```bash
cd /workspace
python3 ai_trading_bot.py
```

### 🔧 **Production Deployment**
```python
from ai_trading_bot import AITradingBot

# Create bot
bot = AITradingBot(demo_mode=False)  # Live trading

# Connect with credentials
await bot.connect(
    email="your_email@example.com",
    password="your_password"
)

# Start automated trading
await bot.start_trading()
```

### 💡 **Single Signal Generation**
```python
from binary_options_ai_model import BinaryOptionsAIModel

# Load pre-trained model
model = BinaryOptionsAIModel()
model.load_model()

# Generate signal from market data
signal = model.predict_signal(market_data)
print(f"Signal: {signal['direction']} - Confidence: {signal['confidence']:.1f}%")
```
