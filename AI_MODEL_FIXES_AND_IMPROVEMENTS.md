## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **LSTM Model Shape Mismatch Errors** ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Training was failing with "Incompatible shapes: [1,96] vs. [1,32]" errors.

**Root Cause**: Feature count mismatch between configuration (24 features) and actual data preparation.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `lstm_model.py` to use consistent 24 features
- Enhanced `prepare_features()` method with proper error handling
- Added feature validation and padding/truncation logic
- Fixed feature column handling to ensure exactly 24 features

**Result**: LSTM model now trains successfully without shape errors.

### 2. **Ensemble Model 'target' Column Errors** ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Ensemble training was failing with "KeyError: 'target'" errors.

**Root Cause**: Ensemble models expected a 'target' column that wasn't being generated.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `_generate_target_labels()` method to create proper target labels
- Updated `prepare_data()` method to handle missing target columns
- Enhanced data preparation with proper error handling
- Added target label generation for binary options trading (BUY/SELL/HOLD)

**Result**: Ensemble models now train successfully with proper target labels.

### 3. **Advanced Features Engine Integration** ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Advanced feature engine wasn't properly integrated with ensemble models.

**Root Cause**: Missing `generate_features()` method for ensemble compatibility.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added simplified `generate_features()` method to `AdvancedFeatureEngine`
- Ensured compatibility with ensemble training pipeline
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Integrated basic technical indicators and market regime features

**Result**: Ensemble models now have access to advanced features for better training.
